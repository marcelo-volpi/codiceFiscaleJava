# Introduction

This project is a Codice Fiscale calculator, which is a tax identification code used in Italy. As a technology enthusiast, I decided to work on this project to challenge myself and improve my skills in programming. I worked on this project alone, studying and researching the necessary technologies and concepts.

##  Technologies used

For this project, I used Java as the programming language and Eclipse as the Integrated Development Environment (IDE). I also used Git for version control and to keep track of my progress throughout the project.

##  How to run the application

To run the application, you can download the source code from this repository and open it in Eclipse. Once you have opened the project in Eclipse, you can run it by clicking on the "Run" button. The application will prompt you to enter the necessary personal information, and then it will calculate the Codice Fiscale based on the entered data.

Remember to change the path of the CSV files based on where you saved them.

##  Improvements

As a self-taught programmer, I am always looking for ways to improve my skills and learn new concepts. Therefore, I welcome any suggestions or feedback on how to improve this project. Whether it is about the code structure, the user interface, or the functionality of the application, any feedback is appreciated.

##  Conclusion

Overall, working on this project was a great learning experience for me, and it allowed me to improve my skills in programming. I am proud of what I have accomplished, and I hope that this project can serve as a useful resource for others who are interested in learning more about Java programming or creating a Codice Fiscale calculator.
